# createActor

Action for executing a transaction on the ICP network.

## Import

```typescript
import { useIdentityKit } from "@nfid/identitykit"
import { idlFactory } from "/path/to/did.js"
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { useIdentityKit } from "@nfid/identitykit"
import { idlFactory } from '/path/to/did.js';

const {agent} = useIdentityKit()

const actor = await Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
  agent,
  CANISTER_ID_TO_CALL
})

const result = await actor.{yourmethod}

// Expected UX
// 1. user is connected with an `account`
// User sees wallet approval pop-up
// 2. user is connected with an Account Delegation where `canisterId` IS listed as a `target`
// User does not see wallet approval pop-up
// 3. user is connected with an Account Delegation where `canisterId` IS NOT listed as a `target`
// User sees wallet approval pop-up
// 4. user is connected with a Relying Party Delegation that has unbounded targets (i.e. II or anonymous NFID Wallet account)
// User does not see wallet approval pop-up
```
