# Featured vs Compact mode

By default, IdentityKit's `modalMode` is set to `featured` (and looks like this):

![NFID Featured Mode](../../../docs/public/img/featured-mode-light.png)

```typescript
export const App = () => (
  <IdentityKitProvider
    featuredWallet="NFIDW"
    {...etc}
  >
    {/* Your App */}
  </IdentityKitProvider>
);
```

Available options for `featuredWallet`:

- `NFIDW`

We also provide a compact mode, which looks like this:

![NFID Compact Mode](../../../docs/public/img/compact-mode-light.png)

To set your modal size to `compact`, just add `modalMode="compact"` as a prop in your
IdentityKitProvider:

```typescript
export const App = () => (
  <IdentityKitProvider
    modalMode="compact"
    {...etc}
  >
    {/* Your App */}
  </IdentityKitProvider>
);
```
