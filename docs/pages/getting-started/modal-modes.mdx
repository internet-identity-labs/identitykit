# Featured vs Compact mode

By default, IdentityKit's `modalMode` is set to `featured` (and looks like this):

![NFID Featured Mode](../../../docs/public/img/featured-mode-light.png)

We also provide a compact mode, which looks like this:

![NFID Compact Mode](../../../docs/public/img/compact-mode-light.png)

To set your modal size to `compact`, just add `modalMode="compact"` as a prop in your
IdentityKitProvider:

```typescript
import { IdentityKitProvider } from '@nfid/identity-kit';

export const App = () => (
  <IdentityKitProvider modalMode="compact" {...etc}>
    {/* Your App */}
  </IdentityKitProvider>
);
```
