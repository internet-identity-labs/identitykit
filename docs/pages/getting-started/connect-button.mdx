# Using and customizing the ConnectWalletButton

This is the main component. It is responsible for rendering the connect/disconnect button.

```typescript
import { ConnectWalletButton } from "@nfid/identitykit/react"

export const YourApp = () => {
  return <ConnectWalletButton />;
};
```

> Note: Make sure your app is wrapped in the necessary providers.
> [Read more](installation#wrap-provider).

## Status

Use the `isConnected` hook to check if a wallet is connected. The wallet address persists in
localStorage until the user disconnects (or the session expires in the case of a delegation).

```typescript
import { useAccount, useDisconnect } from '@nfid/identitykit';

export function Account() {
  const { address } = useAccount()

  return (
    <div>
      {address}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Manual disconnect

`ConnectWalletButton` supports user disconnection, but you may want to hook into it yourself.

```typescript
import { useDisconnect } from '@nfid/identitykit';

export function Account() {
  const { disconnect } = useDisconnect()

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Disconnect</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Props

The `ConnectWalletButton` component exposes several props to customize its appearance, including
toggling the visibility of different elements.

### Label

Use the `label` prop to set a custom ConnectWalletButton text. Default is "Connect wallet".

```typescript
<ConnectWalletButton label="Sign in" />
```
