# Toggling display for CustomConnect

CustomConnect is the feature that supports wallets not yet listed in IdentityKit:

- Your application may not have upgraded to the latest version or
- A wallet may not have created an IdentityKit connector

CustomConnect is on by default but can be turned off in the `IdentityKitProvider` prop:

```typescript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <IdentityKitProvider
      CustomConnect="false"
    >
      {/* Your App */}
    </IdentityKitProvider>
  );
};
```
