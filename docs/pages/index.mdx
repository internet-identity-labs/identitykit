## What is NFID Wallet?

NFID Wallet is a self-custodial identity provider and key management protocol that makes it easy for
anyone to make and use ICP accounts.

## What is NFID Embed?

The [`@nfid/embed`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nfid/embed) npm package is a JavaScript SDK that
easily integrates [NFID's Client Authentication Protocol](/embed/how-it-works/auth-protocol) for
user authentication, registration, and transaction signatures.

NFID Embed package will be replaced by NFID Identity Kit once that package is released.

Get started with [integration](/embed/integration/quickstart).

## What is NFID Identity Kit?

NFID Identity Kit is a set of libraries and tools for integrating standard-conformed ICP wallets
into decentralised applications on the Internet Computer. Developers will be able to easily select
which wallets they want to support in their dApps for authentication, signatures, and transfers.

Currently-planned ICP wallets included in NFID Identity Kit:

- NFID Wallet
- Internet Identity
- Plug Wallet

Get started with [integration](/identity-kit).
