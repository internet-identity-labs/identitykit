## The auth kit for ICP dApps

[NFID IdentityKit](https://identitykit.xyz) is a React library that makes it easy to add wallet
connection to your dapp. It's intuitive, responsive and customizable. Developers will be able to
easily select which wallets they want to support in their apps for authentication, signatures, and
transfers.

## Features

### Instant user onboarding

NFID Wallet (the only on-chain single-signature wallet with email onboarding) and Internet Identity
(DFINITY Foundation's authentication provider) are two self-custody wallets users can get without
downloading a browser extension, mobile app, or writing down a seed phrase.

### Uninterrupted user experiences

Keep users immersed in your dapp by removing wallet approval pop-ups with
[delegations](/guides/removing-wallet-pop-ups). Traditional Web3 UX requires users approve every
transaction that updates smart contract state. With delegations, dapps can design user experiences
with fewer (or no) wallet approval pop-ups.

### Wallet management

Out-of-the-box wallet management for your dapp. Aside from handling the connection and disconnection
of wallets, IdentityKit supports numerous wallets, allows dapps to request wallet signatures and
canister calls, and abstracts all the complexity behind an easy-to-use SDK.

### Customizable

Tweak IdentityKit UI to match your style. You can pick from two
[modal modes](/getting-started/modal-modes) - Featured and Compact - three
[color themes](/getting-started/theming) - light, dark, and system - and choose the
[order and display](/getting-started/wallets-list) of the wallets you want to support.

### Industry standard

The NFID team worked with the community and DFINITY to create the
[standards](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication) apps need to interact with users,
and packaged them into IdentityKit to make working with them easy for developers:

- ICRC-25 to get permissions and the wallet's supported standards
- ICRC-27 to get wallet addresses
- ICRC-34 to get a wallet address delegation
- ICRC-49 to execute authenticated canister calls
