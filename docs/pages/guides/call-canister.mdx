# Requesting canister calls

The following guide teaches you how to call canisters (equivalent of sending and executing
transactions in networks like Ethereum). The example below assumes a wallet is connected and uses
the useCallCanister hook.

## Steps

### 1. Connect Wallet

Follow the [connect-button](/getting-started/connect-button) guide to connect a wallet address.

### 2. Call canister

```typescript
user = IdentityKit.connectedWallet()

user.execute(canisterID, method, args)
```

Canister query methods will not result in a wallet approval pop-up, but canister state mutation
methods may, depending on how users are connected
([Account, Account Delegation, or Relying Party Delegation](/getting-started/auth-options)).

All smart contract canister interactions use the `execute` method on the `connectedWallet` object,
even for requests to [transfer user assets](/guides/request-transfer).
