# Delegation Toolkit

The following guide teaches you how to use delegations so that users don't see wallet pop-ups when
executing calls to your application.

## Steps

### 1. ICRC-28 setup

[ICRC-28](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication/blob/main/topics/icrc_28_trusted_origins.md)
describes the standard method for indicating that a backend canister smart contract trusts a
frontend URL. Each of your backend canister smart contracts must implement this method.

_**ICRC-1, ICRC-7, and other asset canister smart contracts are discouraged from implementing this
method. Wallets may mark your application as a potential scam if you do.**_

#### Rust implementation

Add the following to each of your backend canisters (and any you deploy dynamically). You should
have one item for every domain that should have authority to call your canisters on behalf of
connected wallets without prompting them with transaction approval messages.

```rust
#[update]
fn icrc28_trusted_origins() -> Vec<String> {
    return vec![
        String::from("https://your-canister-id.icp0.io"),
        String::from("https://your-canister-id.raw.icp0.io"),
        String::from("https://your-canister-id.ic0.app"),
        String::from("https://your-canister-id.raw.ic0.app"),
        String::from("https://your-canister-id.icp0.icp-api.io"),
        String::from("https://your-canister-id.icp-api.io"),
        String::from("https://yourcustomdomain.com"),
        String::from("https://yourothercustomdomain.com")
    ];
}
```

### 3. ICRC-10 setup

[ICRC-10](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/blob/main/ICRCs/ICRC-10/ICRC-10.md) describes the standard
method for simplifying the discovery of a canister's supported standards on the Internet Computer.

List ICRC-28 and any other standards your canisters support for each of your canisters.

#### Rust implementation

```rust
#[query]
fn icrc10_supported_standards() -> Vec<Record> {
  record { name = "ICRC-10"; url = "https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/blob/main/ICRCs/ICRC-10/ICRC-10.md"; }
  record { name = "ICRC-28"; url = "https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/tree/main/ICRCs/ICRC-28/ICRC-28.md"; }
  // list all other supported standards
}
```

### 4. Set Canister Targets

When users press the Connect Wallet button with the below configuration, their wallet will compare
your application's URL with the return value from each canister's `icrc28_trusted_origins`. If your
URL is not listed in the response from even one of the target canisters, the wallet will not allow
users to continue with an Account Delegation.

Add `authOption="delegation"` and your list of `targets` to `IdentityKitProvider`.

```typescript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <IdentityKitProvider
      authOption="delegation"
      targets=["canisterID1", "canisterID2",...]
      walletsList=["nfidWallet", "plug", "oisy"]
      modalMode="featured"
      featuredWallet="nfidWallet"
      theme={systemTheme()}
      {...etc}
    >
      {/* Your App */}
    </IdentityKitProvider>
  );
};
```

### 5. Check Delegation

Users will choose whether to continue to your application with a delegation for their main wallet
address or for a wallet address specific to your app's URL. It's straightforward to know which
you've received:

```typescript
if IdentityKit.connectedWallet.isDelegation {
  if IdentityKit.connectedWallet.delegation.hasTargets {
    // This is an Account Delegation for the user's main wallet address

    // Every transaction to a target canister WILL NOT result in a wallet approval pop-up
    // But every transaction to a non-target-canister WILL

  } else {
    // This is a Relying Party Delegation for the user's URL-specific wallet address

    // Every transaction to any canister WILL NOT result in a wallet approval pop-up
  }
} else {
  // Every transaction WILL result in a wallet approval pop-up
}

```
