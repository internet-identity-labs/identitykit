# ICP transfer request `WIP`

The below will display a wallet approval prompt if the user connected with an Account Delegation or
Account.

If the user connected with a Relying Party Delegation, your application can already call the ledger
on the user's behalf.

```typescript
// agent will know which is the currently connected wallet
const { agent } = useIdentityKit()

// you'll need to import the idlFactory for ICP (or any other ledger canister)
// and specify which canister you're calling, in this case the ICP ledger.
// note: it would be very helpful to have a common 'ICRCledgerFactory'
// so individual ledger canister idl's don't need to be imported.
const actor = Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
  agent,
  canisterId: "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai",
})

const destinationPrincipal = SOME_DESTINATION_PRINCIPAL
const address = AccountIdentifier.fromPrincipal({
  principal: Principal.fromText(destinationPrincipal),
}).toHex()

const transferArgs = {
  to: fromHexString(address),
  fee: { e8s: BigInt(10000) },
  memo: BigInt(0),
  from_subaccount: [],
  created_at_time: [],
  amount: { e8s: BigInt(1000) },
}
const response = await actor.transfer(transferArgs)
```
