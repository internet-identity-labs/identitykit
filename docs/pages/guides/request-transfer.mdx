# ICP transfer request

The below will display a wallet approval prompt regardless if the user connected with an Account
Delegation or Account.

If the user connected with a Relying Party Delegation, your application can already call the ledger
on the user's behalf, but this connected wallet address will never be seen elsewhere in the
ecossytem and should therefore not be encouraged to hold a balance.

```typescript
// agent will know which is the currently connected wallet
const agent = useAgent()

// you'll need to import the idlFactory for ICP (or any other ledger canister)
// and specify which canister you're calling, in this case the ICP ledger.
// note: it would be very helpful to have a common 'ICRCledgerFactory'
// so individual ledger canister idl's don't need to be imported.
const actor = Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
  agent,
  canisterId: "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai",
})

const destinationPrincipal = SOME_DESTINATION_PRINCIPAL
const address = AccountIdentifier.fromPrincipal({
  principal: Principal.fromText(destinationPrincipal),
}).toHex()

const transferArgs = {
  to: fromHexString(address),
  fee: { e8s: BigInt(10000) },
  memo: BigInt(0),
  from_subaccount: [],
  created_at_time: [],
  amount: { e8s: BigInt(1000) },
}
const response = await actor.transfer(transferArgs)
```
