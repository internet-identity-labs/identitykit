# Executing canister calls

Your application will likely execute calls to your own canisters
([targets](removing-wallet-pop-ups#1-on-chain-wallet-support)) and others (non-targets i.e. ledger
canisters).

The following guide teaches you how to set up actors to each depending on how the user
authenticated, whether the canister is a target, and if the method being called requires a user to
execute.

## Steps

### 1. Connect Wallet

Follow the [connect-wallet](/getting-started/connect-wallet) guide to connect a wallet address.

### 2. Import idlFactories

You'll need an idlFactory for each canister you want to call.

```typescript
// import the idlFactory for your canister that implements icrc28_trusted_origins
import { idlFactory as targetIdlFactory } from "/path/to/target/did.js"

// import the idlFactory of another canister (i.e. ICRC1 token ledger)
import { idlFactory as nontargetIdlFactory } from "/path/to/nontarget/did.js"
```

### 3. Set up agents

IdentityKit comes bundled with an agent that can be used to create actors for calling canisters. You
should also import `@dfinity/agent` for cases when your users connect with an anonymous relying
party delegation or when you need to query something for which the user doesn't need to execute
themselves.

```typescript
import { useIdentityKit } from "@nfid/identitykit/react"
import { HttpAgent, Actor } from "@dfinity/agent"

const { delegationType, identity, agent } = useIdentityKit()

// Create an unauthenticatedAgent when you need to execute calls for which the user doesn't need to execute themselves
const [unauthenticatedAgent, setUnauthenticatedAgent] = useState<HttpAgent | undefined>()

useEffect(() => {
  HttpAgent.create({ host: "https://icp-api.io/" }).then(setUnauthenticatedAgent)
}, [])

// Create an HttpAgent in case the connected delegation is not for their wallet address
const [authenticatedNonTargetAgent, setAuthenticatedNonTargetAgent] = useState<
  HttpAgent | undefined
>()

useEffect(() => {
  if (identity && delegationType === IdentityKitDelegationType.ANONYMOUS) {
    HttpAgent.create({ identity, host: "https://icp-api.io/" }).then(setAuthenticatedNonTargetAgent)
  }
}, [identity, delegationType])
```

</Callout>

### 4. Create actors

Create actors for the canisters you want to call with the idlFactories you imported and their
canister IDs.

```typescript
import { useIdentityKit } from "@nfid/identitykit/react"

const { agent, identity, delegationType } = useIdentityKit()

// Actor for one of your application's target canisters
const targetActor =
  agent &&
  Actor.createActor(targetIdlFactory, {
    agent,
    canisterId: TARGET_CANISTER_ID_TO_CALL,
  })

// Actor for a different canister in the ecosystem (i.e. icrc2_approve)
const nonTargetActor =
  identity && delegationType === IdentityKitDelegationType.ANONYMOUS && authenticatedNonTargetAgent
    ? Actor.createActor(nontargetIdlFactory, {
        agent: authenticatedNonTargetAgent,
        canisterId: NON_TARGET_CANISTER_ID_TO_CALL,
      })
    : undefined

// Actor for methods the user doesn't need to be authenticated to call (i.e. icrc2_allowance)
// These will never result in a wallet approval prompt.
const nonTargetUnauthenticatedActor =
  unauthenticatedAgent &&
  Actor.createActor(nontargetIdlFactory, {
    agent: unauthenticatedAgent,
    canisterId: NON_TARGET_CANISTER_ID_TO_CALL,
  })
```

### 5. Call canister

Execute your calls.

```typescript
if (actor) {
  const result = await actor.{yourmethod}
}
```

## Note on UX

The user may see a wallet approval pop-up depending on how they authenticated:

| Auth option              | Wallet address     | Wallet approval pop-up for executing calls to your canisters | Wallet approval pop-up for executing calls to other canisters |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account                  | Global             | Yes                                                          | Yes                                                           |
| Account Delegation       | Global             | No                                                           | Yes                                                           |
| Relying Party Delegation | Unique to dApp URL | No                                                           | No                                                            |
