# Executing authenticated canister calls

The following guide teaches you how to execute canister transactions such that the `caller` is your
connected user.

## Steps

### 1. Connect Wallet

Follow the [connect-button](/getting-started/connect-button) guide to connect a wallet address.

### 2. Import idlFactories

You'll need an idlFactory for each canister you want to call.

```typescript
import { idlFactory } from "/path/to/did.js"
```

### 3. Import agent

IdentityKit comes bundled with an agent that can be used to create actors for calling canisters.

```typescript
import { useIdentityKit } from "@nfid/identitykit/react"

const { agent } = useIdentityKit()
```

### 4. Create actors

Create an actor for the canister you want to call with the idlFactory you imported and its canister
ID.

```typescript
const actor = await Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
  agent,
  CANISTER_ID_TO_CALL,
})
```

### 5. Call canister

Execute your calls.

```typescript
const result = await actor.{yourmethod}
```

## Note on UX

The user may see a wallet approval pop-up depending on how they authenticated:

| Auth option              | Wallet address     | Wallet approval pop-up for executing calls to your canisters | Wallet approval pop-up for executing calls to other canisters |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account                  | Global             | Yes                                                          | Yes                                                           |
| Account Delegation       | Global             | No                                                           | Yes                                                           |
| Relying Party Delegation | Unique to dApp URL | No                                                           | No                                                            |
