# What is an Account?

An Account is a principal/subaccount pair, better known as an
[ICRC1 account](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/icrc1-standard#textual-encoding-of-accounts).
Other decentralized networks (i.e. EVM, SOL) started with accounts as the primary identifier and
required users to approve every transaction. For better or worse ICP started with the "delegation",
which is effectively an Account that's been pre-approved to make calls on behalf of the user (read
more about [delegations](/miscellaneous/delegation-toolkit)).

The following guide teaches you how to use Accounts instead of Delegations so that every
authenticated transaction will display a wallet prompt for explicit user approval.

## Steps

### 1. Set ACCOUNTS authType

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <IdentityKitProvider authType={IdentityKitAuthType.ACCOUNTS}>
      <YourApp />
    </IdentityKitProvider>
  )
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Check [useAccounts](/hooks/useAccounts) hook to read about how to retrieve connected accounts.
</Callout>

### 2. Execute calls

Follow the same steps for [executing canister calls](/getting-started/executing-canister-calls) with
the understanding that every authenticated call will result in an approval prompt.
