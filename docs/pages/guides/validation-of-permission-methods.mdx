# Validation of Permission Methods

Each wallet is designed to support a set of standards, with each standard specifying a list of
methods. It is crucial that the wallet only grants permission to methods explicitly expected by the
signer, as failing to do so may lead to potential security vulnerabilities in the future.
Maintaining a list of expected permission methods and raising an error when an unapproved method is
encountered is highly recommended.

The
[Mocked Signer](https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/identitykit/blob/main/examples/react-signer/src/service/auth.service.ts#L84)
can be used as an example of a validation implementation:

```typescript
export enum PermissionMethod {
  ICRC27_ACCOUNTS = "icrc27_accounts",
  ICRC34_DELEGATION = "icrc34_delegation",
  ICRC49_CALL_CANISTER = "icrc49_call_canister",
}

function getPermissionMethod(methodName: string): PermissionMethod {
  const method = PermissionMethod[methodName.toUpperCase() as keyof typeof PermissionMethod]

  if (!method) {
    throw new NotSupportedError(`The method name ${methodName} is not supported`)
  }

  return method
}
```

By adhering to these recommendations, permission method validation can be successfully implemented
using IdentityKit.
