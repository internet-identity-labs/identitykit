# Adding a New Signer to Identity Kit

To add your wallet as a signer to Identity Kit, follow these four steps:

1. Clone the Identity Kit repository.
2. Add your wallet configuration.
3. Create a pull request.
4. Wait for approval and then merge the pull request.

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Identity Kit repository

First, clone the Identity Kit repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the
following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/identitykit.git
```

### 2. Add your wallet configuration

Open the `packages/identitykit/src/lib/signers.ts` file in your preferred code editor and add your
wallet configuration. Ensure that each field is correctly filled out:

- id: A unique identifier for your wallet. Make sure it is unique to avoid conflicts.
- providerUrl: The URL to connect to your wallet. This URL should be compatible with ICRC standards.
- transportType: The method your wallet uses to communicate with the client's DApp. If your wallet
  is an extension, use `TransportType.EXTENSION`. For web DApps, you can choose between
  `TransportType.POPUP` and `TransportType.IFRAME`, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
- popupHeight and popupWidth: The dimensions of the sign-in window.
- label: The display name of your wallet.
- icon: A base64-encoded SVG image representing your wallet.

Here is an example configuration:

```typescript
const YourWalletSigner: SignerConfig = {
  id: "YourWalletSignerIdentifier",
  providerUrl: "https://your-wallet-rpc-url.com",
  transportType: TransportType.POPUP,
  popupHeight: 640,
  popupWidth: 450,
  label: "Your Wallet Name",
  icon: "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0ac+Cg==",
}
```

### 3. Create a pull request

After adding your wallet configuration, commit your changes and push them to the repository. Then,
create a pull request (PR).

### 4. Wait for approval and then merge the pull request

Wait for the maintainers to review and approve your pull request. Once approved, you can merge it
into the main branch.

By following these steps, you will successfully add your wallet as a signer to Identity Kit.
