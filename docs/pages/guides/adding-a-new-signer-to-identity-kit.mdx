# Adding a New Signer to IdentityKit

To add your wallet as a signer to IdentityKit, follow these four steps:

1. Clone the IdentityKit repository.
2. Add your wallet configuration.
3. Create a pull request.
4. Wait for approval and merge of the pull request.

## Steps

### 1. Clone the IdentityKit repository

First, clone the IdentityKit repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the
following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/identitykit.git
```

### 2. Add your wallet configuration

Open the `packages/identitykit/src/lib/signers.ts` file in your preferred code editor and add your
wallet configuration. Ensure that each field is correctly filled out:

- id: A unique identifier for your wallet. Make sure it is unique to avoid conflicts.
- description: The description shown when the wallet is in feature mode.
- providerUrl: The URL to connect to your wallet. This URL should be compatible with
  [ICRC standards](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication/tree/main).
- transportType: The method your wallet uses to communicate with the client's dApp. If your wallet
  is an extension, use `TransportType.EXTENSION`. For web dApps, you can choose
  `TransportType.NEW_TAB`.
- label: The display name of your wallet.
- icon: A base64-encoded SVG image representing your wallet.

Here is an example configuration:

```typescript
const YourWalletSigner: SignerConfig = {
  id: "YourWalletSignerIdentifier",
  description: "Your wallet description.",
  providerUrl: "https://your-wallet-rpc-url.com",
  transportType: TransportType.NEW_TAB,
  label: "Your Wallet Name",
  icon: "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0ac+Cg==",
}
```

### 3. Create a pull request

After adding your wallet configuration, commit your changes and push them to the repository. Then,
create a pull request (PR).

### 4. Wait for approval and merge of the pull request

Wait for the maintainers to review and approve your pull request. Once approved, it will be merged
into the main branch, and the new version of the
[@nfid/identitykit NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nfid/identitykit) will be released.

By following these steps, you will successfully add your wallet as a signer to IdentityKit.
