## Target Canisters

3rd party application MUST set an array of target canisters to which delegation identity will make
authenticated calls without user approvals. These canisters SHOULD be under the 3rd party
application's control, otherwise the developer opens a trust assumption that other canister
controllers won't carry out drain attacks on their shared pool of users.

## Rust Implementation

Each target canister that wallet providers will query (as an update call for secure consensus)
should have method `icrc28_trusted_origins()`:

```rust
#[derive(CandidType, Deserialize, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
pub struct SupportedStandard {
    pub url: String,
    pub name: String,
}

#[query]
fn icrc10_supported_standards() -> Vec<SupportedStandard> {
    vec![
        SupportedStandard {
            url: "https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/blob/main/ICRCs/ICRC-10/ICRC-10.md".to_string(),
            name: "ICRC-10".to_string(),
        },
        SupportedStandard {
            url: "https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication/blob/main/topics/icrc_28_trusted_origins.md".to_string(),
            name: "ICRC-28".to_string(),
        },
    ]
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, CandidType, Deserialize)]
pub struct Icrc28TrustedOriginsResponse {
    pub trusted_origins: Vec<String>
}

#[update]
fn icrc28_trusted_origins() -> Icrc28TrustedOriginsResponse {
    let trusted_origins = vec![
        String::from("dscvr.one") // to be replaced with application's frontend origin(s)
    ];

    return Icrc28TrustedOriginsResponse { trusted_origins }
}
```

> Note: icrc10_supported_standards of the target canister must not include standards supporting
> tradable assets. In particular, it must not include ICRC-1, ICRC-2, ICRC-7 and ICRC-37.
