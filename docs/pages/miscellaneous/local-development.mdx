# Developing ICP apps locally

Because signatures generated from ICP mainnet do not work in local development, executing calls to
locally running canisters requires wallet signatures to come from locally installed wallets.

One option is to install the NFID Wallet, Internet Identity, and OISY canisters locally. Another
option is to use a simple wallet for development purposes and toggle production wallets on when
deploying to mainnet.

We've chosen the latter option for simplicity.
