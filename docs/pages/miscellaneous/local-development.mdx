# Developing ICP apps locally

Because signatures generated from ICP mainnet do not work in local development, executing
calls to locally running canisters requires wallet signatures to come from locally installed
wallets.

One option is to install the NFID Wallet, Internet Identity, and Oisy canisters locally.
Another option is to use a simple wallet for development purposes and toggle production
wallets on when deploying to mainnet.

We've chosen the latter option for simplicity.
