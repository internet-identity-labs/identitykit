# Working with accounts vs delegations

Users will connect to your dApp by providing one of the following:

1. An account object or
2. A delegation object

The differences can be summarized in the table below:

| Auth option              | Wallet address     | Wallet approval pop-up for executing calls to your canisters | Wallet approval pop-up for executing calls to other canisters |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account                  | Global             | Yes                                                          | Yes                                                           |
| Account Delegation       | Global             | No                                                           | Yes                                                           |
| Relying Party Delegation | Unique to dApp URL | No                                                           | No                                                            |

Account objects are wallet addresses with standard web3 interactivity, namely that every call will
require explicit user approval to execute.

Delegations are accounts with the authority to execute transactions on the user's behalf, resulting
in the removal of wallet approval pop-ups. A simple example is "Alice delegates to you the ability
to execute calls to smart contract canisters A, B, and C on her behalf".

The example above is what's called an "Account Delegation" where Alice connects with her wallet
address and gives your dApp permission to execute calls as herself only to a whitelist of smart
contract canisters as per
[ICRC-28](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication/blob/main/topics/icrc_28_trusted_origins.md).
Calls made to smart contract canisters outside the whitelist will result in a wallet approval pop-up
for that user.

If you wish to remove all wallet pop-ups, you may request a delegation without a whitelist. This
global permission allows you to execute any smart contract canister call on behalf of the user, but
since you could theoretically execute sensitive transactions without explicit user permission (i.e.
transfer assets), **wallets will generate delegations with a wallet address unique to your
application's URL**, hence the name for this type of delegation: "Relying Party Delegation". This
means you will not know Alice is the one authenticating, since the wallet address for this
delegation will be unique to your dApp's URL and never be seen again across the rest of the ICP
ecosystem.

## Accounts

Consider requesting a user's account when building dApps that:

- Look up account balance/data, and
- Are meant to give users the highest degree of security and autonomy

| Advantages                                                   | Disadvantages                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple integration                                           | Wallet prompts can be confusing for new Web3 users                  |
| Enables interoperability of data and assets across ecosystem | Would require a user signature to authenticate ownership of address |
| Familiar Web3 experience                                     |                                                                     |

### Usage

Add the `authOption="account"` prop.

```typescript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <IdentityKitProvider authOption="account" {...etc}>
      {/* Your App */}
    </IdentityKitProvider>
  );
};
```

## Account Delegations

Consider requesting a user's Account Delegation when building dApps that:

- Look up account balance/data, and
- Remove wallet approval pop-ups when making calls to smart contract canisters under your dApp's
  control (i.e. for chat and other social applications that save profile data)

| Advantages                                                   | Disadvantages                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| No wallet approval pop-ups for canisters under your control  | Slightly more integration effort |
| Enables interoperability of data and assets across ecosystem |                                  |
| Familiar Web3 experience                                     |                                  |

### Usage

Add the `authOption="delegation"` prop and populate the `targets=""` prop with a list of canister
IDs and follow the guide to [remove wallet approval pop-ups](/guides/removing-wallet-pop-ups).

```typescript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <IdentityKitProvider authOption="delegation" targets="" {...etc}>
      {/* Your App */}
    </IdentityKitProvider>
  );
};
```

## Relying Party Delegations

Consider requesting a user's relying party delegation when building dApps that:

- Are meant to give users isolated profiles from other dApps on the network

| Advantages        | Disadvantages                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No wallet pop-ups | Users are isolated from the rest of the ecosystem by default |
|                   | More effort to make data interoperable across ecosystem      |

### Usage

Add the `authOption="delegation"` prop.

```typescript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <IdentityKitProvider authOption="delegation" {...etc}>
      {/* Your App */}
    </IdentityKitProvider>
  );
};
```
